#ABOUT MYSELF\
Being pushed into the deep end of learning web programming can be a trying time, but adversity breeds success. You don’t know what you’re capable of until you’re tested, and you might surprise yourself with hidden talents and abilities. I state for myself that “being unsure and being curious about everything is not the worst thing that could happen”. In fact, it could be the best thing that’s happened to me: many successful programmers remember moments of difficulty as those that demanded the most strength – projects at the limit of their ability, demanding fieldwork, high-stress exam times – and proved the most rewarding.
